# First-Project
First project of the UT Data Analysis &amp; Visualization boot camp

## Datasets
Drug names, sales, and number of units sold were retrieved from https://www.drugs.com/stats/top100/sales by copying and pasting text from the website into .txt files. The resulting files were thus poorly formatted but were preprocessed from this initial format into readable .csv files. Prior to preprocessing, assumptions about the consistency of the original formatting were tested in the 'test' branch to ensure any flukes were properly accounted for.
